# time-series-forecasting
This repository contains code and analysis for time series forecasting using deep learning models (LSTM and GRU) as part of the Predictive Modeling and Analytics course. The goal is to compare the performance of LSTM and GRU models on a real-world dataset and provide insights into their strengths and limitations for time series problems.
